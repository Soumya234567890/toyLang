# 🔧 My Own Programming Language

I built my **own programming language** from scratch by implementing all major phases of a compiler — from lexical analysis to code generation. This project is the result of a deep dive into how programming languages truly work under the hood.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Lexical Analysis:** Breaks input into tokens  
2. **Parsing:** Constructs an abstract syntax tree  
3. **Semantic Checks:** Validates structure and types  
4. **Intermediate Code:** Generates code in an intermediate form  
5. **Target Code:** Outputs executable instructions or pseudo-code

## 🔍 Sample Code

```txt
let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    print("x is large");
}
